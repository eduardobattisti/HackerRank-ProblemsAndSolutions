<h1>Multiple of 3 and 5</h1>

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. 

<h3>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.</h3>

<h4>Input Format:</h4>
First line contains  that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by  lines, each containing an integer, .

<h4>Constraints</h4>
• 1 <= T <= 10 ** 5 </br>
• 1 <= T <= 10 ** 9

Output Format

For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

Sample Input 0
2
10
100

Sample Output 0
23
2318

Explanation 0:
For N=10, if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Similarly for N=100, we get 2318.
